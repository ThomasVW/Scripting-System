# Scripting-System
Thomas Van Wynendaele High-School: Télécom Saint-Étienne - France Section: "Computing &amp; Networks" This archival script was developped to download a zip from web server, to operate on it and to send it to SFTP server. I developped it in the context of my studies to train my networking and scripting skills.
